                        I grew up in Amherst, NH.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Amherst has a population of around 13,000, so it is relatively small.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                        Something no one would expect is I have never worn contacts.

                        I also love playing sports and being outdoors, with my favorite activities being:
